,<get player name>,,,
???,Ah! [PLAYER_NAME]! Nice to meet you...,,,
???,As your grandather must have mentioned, my name is Bitwise,,
Bitwise,I’m the mayor of Terminille, this town.,,
Mayor Bitwise,Safe to say, this part of town is not that well known,,
Mayor Bitwise,Terminille is far from the advancements of Syntax City, or Codeopolis, but it is still one of the ‘big three’, haha
Mayor Bitwise,but all glory isn’t lost! There are still thriving things in this town,,,
Mayor Bitwise,we all rely on the resources from mines... which reminds me, isn’t that why you are here?,,
Mayor Bitwise,Don’t fret, mining is one of the biggest things you can do to live here!,,
Mayor Bitwise,Sorry, I must be rambling!,,
Mayor Bitwise,I do that a lot, haha, especially with this age thing catching up on me...,
Mayor Bitwise,Anyways, why don’t we get you out of here!,,
Mayor Bitwise,exiting Railway Station...,,,
Mayor Bitwise,traversing through the city is very easy in Terminille,,,
Mayor Bitwise,all you gotta do is go the main street, and then click the letter corresponing to the place you want to visit,,
Mayor Bitwise,let’s try entering the mine now, click ‘m’,,
,<get player input>,,,
,entering mine...,,,
Mayor Bitwise,Great! We are now *cough* *cough* inside the *cough*,,,
Mayor Bitwise,....mine. I don’t do good with closed spaces.,,,
Mayor Bitwise,You can mine by clicking ‘m’. Try it...,,,
Mayor Bitwise,Well, mining by hands can take quite a bit of time!,,
Mayor Bitwise,You can speed up mining by buying a pickaxe from the guild store, which, will open in a week!,
Mayor Bitwise,This is usually a part of hospitality where I would give you an old run-of-the mill pickaxe and 500$ as a starting bonus,,,
Mayor Bitwise,but I guess we both can agree that it’s a bit cliche, haha.,,
Mayor Bitwise,let’s get that money with our own hardwork, shall we *cough*.,,
Mayor Bitwise,Anyway, I gotta get going, I’ll leave you be in the mine, to get used to it...
Mayor Bitwise,and if you need any other help, you can come by- well, it’s all self-explanatory, you won’t need me
Mayor Bitwise,If that is all, I’ll get going then... happy thriving!,,
,[Bitwise leaves the mine],,,
,click ‘m’ to continue mining.,,,
